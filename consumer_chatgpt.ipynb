    "### Authors: Ruben Tak, Nils Jennissen, David Landeo\n",
    "This task involves setting up a data streaming pipeline to extract and process posts and comments from Reddit. The data will be structured and sent through a socket, then received and processed by another process. References to users, posts, and external sites will be extracted and counted, and the top 10 important words will be identified using TF-IDF. Optional features include sentiment analysis, additional metrics, saving results to a database, creating a Jupyter Notebook dashboard, and visualizing the results on a web page. The deliverables include Python code, instructions, output data files, and optional Docker setup."

I am one of the founders of Reddit, and I‚Äôve been CEO since 2015. On Wednesday, I celebrated my 18th cake-day, which is about 17 years and 9 months longer than I thought this project would last. To be with you here today on Reddit‚Äîeven in a heated moment like this‚Äîis an honor.\\n\\nI want to talk with you today about what‚Äôs happening within the community and frustration stemming from changes we are making to access our API. I spoke to a number of moderators on Wednesday and yesterday afternoon and our product and community teams have had further  conversations with mods as well.\\n\\nFirst, let me share the background on this topic as well as some clarifying details. On 4/18, we [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) that we would update access to the API, including premium access for third parties who require additional capabilities and higher usage limits. Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs been a lot of confusion over what these changes mean, and I want to highlight what these changes mean for moderators and developers.  \\n\\n* **Terms of Service**\\n   * Effective June 19, 2023, our updated [Data API Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms), together with our [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), replaced the existing Data API terms.\\n* **Free Data API** \\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate limits to use the Data API free of charge are:\\n      * 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id if you are using OAuth authentication and 10 queries per minute if you are not using OAuth authentication.\\n      * Today, over 90% of apps fall into this category and can continue to access the Data API for free.\\n* **Premium Enterprise API / Third-party apps**\\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate for apps that require higher usage limits is $0.24 per 1K API calls (less than $1.00 per user / month for a typical Reddit third-party app).\\n   * Some apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, and Sync have decided this pricing doesn‚Äôt work for their businesses and will close before pricing goes into effect. \\n   * For the other apps, we will continue talking. We acknowledge that the timeline we gave was tight; we are happy to engage with folks who want to work with us.\\n* **Mod Tools**\\n   * We know many communities rely on tools like RES, ContextMod, Toolbox, etc., and these tools will continue to have free access to the Data API.\\n   * We‚Äôre working together with Pushshift to [restore access](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/13w6j20/advancing_communityled_moderation_an_update_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for verified moderators.\\n* **Mod Bots**\\n   * If you‚Äôre creating free bots that help moderators and users (e.g. haikubot, setlistbot, etc), please continue to do so.

We are currently in a closed beta with hundreds of developers (sign up [here](https://developers.reddit.com/)). For those of you who have been around a while, it is the spiritual successor to both the API and Custom CSS.\\n* **Explicit Content** \\n   * Effective July 5, 2023, we will limit access to mature content via our Data API as part of an ongoing effort to provide guardrails to how explicit content and communities on Reddit are discovered and viewed. \\n   * This change will not impact any moderator bots or extensions.\\nIn our conversations with moderators and developers, we heard two areas of feedback we plan to address. \\n\\n* **Accessibility** \\\\- We want everyone to be able to use Reddit. As a result, non-commercial, accessibility-focused apps and tools will continue to have free access. We‚Äôre working with apps like RedReader and Dystopia and a few others to ensure they can continue to access the Data API.\\n* **Better mobile moderation** \\\\- We need more efficient moderation tools, especially on mobile.

Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs been a lot of confusion over what these changes mean, and I want to highlight what these changes mean for moderators and developers.  \\n\\n* **Terms of Service**\\n   * Effective June 19, 2023, our updated [Data API Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms), together with our [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), replaced the existing Data API terms.\\n* **Free Data API** \\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate limits to use the Data API free of charge are:\\n      * 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id if you are using OAuth authentication and 10 queries per minute if you are not using OAuth authentication.\\n      * Today, over 90% of apps fall into this category and can continue to access the Data API for free.\\n* **Premium Enterprise API / Third-party apps**\\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate for apps that require higher usage limits is $0.24 per 1K API calls (less than $1.00 per user / month for a typical Reddit third-party app).\\n   * Some apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, and Sync have decided this pricing doesn‚Äôt work for their businesses and will close before pricing goes into effect. \\n   * For the other apps, we will continue talking. We acknowledge that the timeline we gave was tight; we are happy to engage with folks who want to work with us.\\n* **Mod Tools**\\n   * We know many communities rely on tools like RES, ContextMod, Toolbox, etc., and these tools will continue to have free access to the Data API.\\n   * We‚Äôre working together with Pushshift to [restore access](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/13w6j20/advancing_communityled_moderation_an_update_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for verified moderators.\\n* **Mod Bots**\\n   * If you‚Äôre creating free bots that help moderators and users (e.g. haikubot, setlistbot, etc), please continue to do so.
