    "### Course: Real-time Data Analysis\n",
    "### Authors: Ruben Tak, Nils Jennissen, David Landeo\n",
    "This task involves setting up a data streaming pipeline to extract and process posts and comments from Reddit. The data will be structured and sent through a socket, then received and processed by another process. References to users, posts, and external sites will be extracted and counted, and the top 10 important words will be identified using TF-IDF. Optional features include sentiment analysis, additional metrics, saving results to a database, creating a Jupyter Notebook dashboard, and visualizing the results on a web page. The deliverables include Python code, instructions, output data files, and optional Docker setup."

On 4/18, we [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) that we would update access to the API, including premium access for third parties who require additional capabilities and higher usage limits. Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use. \\n\\nThere’s been a lot of confusion over what these changes mean, and I want to highlight what these changes mean for moderators and developers.  \\n\\n* **Terms of Service**\\n   * Effective June 19, 2023, our updated [Data API Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms), together with our [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), replaced the existing Data API terms.\\n* **Free Data API** \\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate limits to use the Data API free of charge are:\\n      * 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id if you are using OAuth authentication and 10 queries per minute if you are not using OAuth authentication.\\n      * Today, over 90% of apps fall into this category and can continue to access the Data API for free.\\n* **Premium Enterprise API / Third-party apps**\\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate for apps that require higher usage limits is $0.24 per 1K API calls (less than $1.00 per user / month for a typical Reddit third-party app).\\n   * Some apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, and Sync have decided this pricing doesn’t work for their businesses and will close before pricing goes into effect. \\n   * For the other apps, we will continue talking. We acknowledge that the timeline we gave was tight; we are happy to engage with folks who want to work with us.\\n* **Mod Tools**\\n   * We know many communities rely on tools like RES, ContextMod, Toolbox, etc., and these tools will continue to have free access to the Data API.\\n   * We’re working together with Pushshift to [restore access](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/13w6j20/advancing_communityled_moderation_an_update_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for verified moderators.\\n* **Mod Bots**\\n   * If you’re creating free bots that help moderators and users (e.g. haikubot, setlistbot, etc), please continue to do so. You can contact us [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=14868593862164) if you have a bot that requires access to the Data API above the free limits. \\n   * Developer Platform is a new platform designed to let users and developers expand the Reddit experience by providing powerful features for building moderation tools, creative tools, games, and more. We are currently in a closed beta with hundreds of developers (sign up [here](https://developers.reddit.com/)). For those of you who have been around a while, it is the spiritual successor to both the API and Custom CSS.\\n* **Explicit Content** \\n   * Effective July 5, 2023, we will limit access to mature content via our Data API as part of an ongoing effort to provide guardrails to how explicit content and communities on Reddit are discovered and viewed. \\n   * This change will not impact any moderator bots or extensions.\\nIn our conversations with moderators and developers, we heard two areas of feedback we plan to address. \\n\\n* **Accessibility** \\\\- We want everyone to be able to use Reddit. As a result, non-commercial, accessibility-focused apps and tools will continue to have free access. We’re working with apps like RedReader and Dystopia and a few others to ensure they can continue to access the Data API.\\n* **Better mobile moderation** \\\\- We need more efficient moderation tools, especially on mobile. They are coming. We’ve [launched ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/142kh8s/improvement_to_the_mobile_mod_queue/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)improvements to some tools recently and will continue to do so. About 3% of mod actions come from third-party apps, and we’ve reached out to communities who moderate almost exclusively using these apps to ensure we address their needs.\\n\\nMods, I appreciate all the time you’ve spent with us this week, and all the time prior as well. Your feedback is invaluable. We respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private. We are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open accessible place for people to find community and belonging. \\n\\nI will be sticking around to answer questions along with other admins. We know answers are tough to find, so we're switching the default sort to Q&A mode.

Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use. \\n\\nThere’s been a lot of confusion over what these changes mean, and I want to highlight what these changes mean for moderators and developers.  \\n\\n* **Terms of Service**\\n   * Effective June 19, 2023, our updated [Data API Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/data-api-terms), together with our [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), replaced the existing Data API terms.\\n* **Free Data API** \\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate limits to use the Data API free of charge are:\\n      * 100 queries per minute per OAuth client id if you are using OAuth authentication and 10 queries per minute if you are not using OAuth authentication.\\n      * Today, over 90% of apps fall into this category and can continue to access the Data API for free.\\n* **Premium Enterprise API / Third-party apps**\\n   * Effective July 1, 2023, the rate for apps that require higher usage limits is $0.24 per 1K API calls (less than $1.00 per user / month for a typical Reddit third-party app).\\n   * Some apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun, and Sync have decided this pricing doesn’t work for their businesses and will close before pricing goes into effect. \\n   * For the other apps, we will continue talking. We acknowledge that the timeline we gave was tight; we are happy to engage with folks who want to work with us.\\n* **Mod Tools**\\n   * We know many communities rely on tools like RES, ContextMod, Toolbox, etc., and these tools will continue to have free access to the Data API.\\n   * We’re working together with Pushshift to [restore access](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/13w6j20/advancing_communityled_moderation_an_update_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for verified moderators.\\n* **Mod Bots**\\n   * If you’re creating free bots that help moderators and users (e.g. haikubot, setlistbot, etc), please continue to do so. You can contact us [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=14868593862164) if you have a bot that requires access to the Data API above the free limits. \\n   * Developer Platform is a new platform designed to let users and developers expand the Reddit experience by providing powerful features for building moderation tools, creative tools, games, and more. We are currently in a closed beta with hundreds of developers (sign up [here](https://developers.reddit.com/)). For those of you who have been around a while, it is the spiritual successor to both the API and Custom CSS.\\n* **Explicit Content** \\n   * Effective July 5, 2023, we will limit access to mature content via our Data API as part of an ongoing effort to provide guardrails to how explicit content and communities on Reddit are discovered and viewed. \\n   * This change will not impact any moderator bots or extensions.\\nIn our conversations with moderators and developers, we heard two areas of feedback we plan to address. \\n\\n* **Accessibility** \\\\- We want everyone to be able to use Reddit. As a result, non-commercial, accessibility-focused apps and tools will continue to have free access. We’re working with apps like RedReader and Dystopia and a few others to ensure they can continue to access the Data API.\\n* **Better mobile moderation** \\\\- We need more efficient moderation tools, especially on mobile. They are coming. We’ve [launched ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/142kh8s/improvement_to_the_mobile_mod_queue/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)improvements to some tools recently and will continue to do so. About 3% of mod actions come from third-party apps, and we’ve reached out to communities who moderate almost exclusively using these apps to ensure we address their needs.\\n\\nMods, I appreciate all the time you’ve spent with us this week, and all the time prior as well. Your feedback is invaluable. We respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private. We are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open accessible place for people to find community and belonging. \\n\\nI will be sticking around to answer questions along with other admins.

Well, that's exactly what 230 would allow if there aren't limits. \\n\\nWithout moderation limits there's no way to delineate between publishers, (liable for content because they exert massive content control), and platforms (immune from liability because they supposedly don't exert massive content control).\", 'post': \"Hi everyone, I’m u/traceroo a/k/a Ben Lee, Reddit’s General Counsel, and I wanted to give you all a heads up regarding an important upcoming Supreme Court case on Section 230 and why defending this law matters to all of us.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** The Supreme Court is hearing for the first time a case regarding Section 230, a decades-old internet law that provides important legal protections for anyone who moderates, votes on, or deals with other people’s content online. The Supreme Court has never spoken on 230, and the plaintiffs are arguing for a narrow interpretation of 230. To fight this, Reddit, alongside several moderators, have jointly filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing in support of Section 230.\\n\\n**Why 230 matters**\\n\\nSo, what is Section 230 and why should you care? Congress passed Section 230 to fix a weirdness in the existing law that made platforms that try to remove horrible content (like Prodigy which, similar to Reddit, used forum moderators) more vulnerable to lawsuits than those that didn’t bother. 230 is super broad and plainly stated: “No provider or user” of a service shall be held liable as the “publisher or speaker” of information provided by another. Note that Section 230 protects users of Reddit, just as much as it protects Reddit and its communities.\\n\\nSection 230 was designed to encourage moderation and protect those who interact with other people’s content: it protects our moderators who decide whether to approve or remove a post, it protects our admins who design and keep the site running, it protects everyday users who vote on content they like or…don’t. It doesn’t protect against criminal conduct, but it does shield folks from getting dragged into court by those that don’t agree with how you curate content, whether through a downvote or a removal or a ban.\\n\\nMuch of the current debate regarding Section 230 today revolves around the biggest platforms, all of whom moderate very differently than how Reddit (and old-fashioned Prodigy) operates. u/spez [testified](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/hearing-on-fostering-a-healthier-internet-to-protect-consumers/) in Congress a few years back explaining why even small changes to Section 230 can have really unintended consequences, often hurting everyone other than the largest platforms that Congress is trying to reign in.\\n\\n**What’s happening?**\\n\\nWhich brings us to the Supreme Court. This is the first opportunity for the Supreme Court to say anything about Section 230 (every other court in the US has already agreed that 230 provides very broad protections that include “recommendations” of content). The facts of the case, Gonzalez v. Google, are horrible (terrorist content appearing on Youtube), but the stakes go way beyond YouTube. In order to sue YouTube, the plaintiffs have argued that Section 230 does not protect anyone who “recommends” content. Alternatively, they argue that Section 230 doesn’t protect algorithms that “recommend” content.\\n\\nYesterday, we filed a “friend of the court” [amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252674/20230119145120402_Gonzalez%20-%20Reddit%20bottomside%20amicus%20brief.pdf) to impress upon the Supreme Court the importance of Section 230 to the community moderation model, and we did it jointly with several moderators of various communities. This is the first time Reddit as a company has filed a Supreme Court brief and we got special permission to have the mods sign on to the brief without providing their actual names, a significant departure from normal Supreme Court procedure. Regardless of how one may feel about the case and how YouTube recommends content, it was important for us all to highlight the impact of a sweeping Supreme Court decision that ignores precedent and, more importantly, ignores how moderation happens on Reddit. You can [read the brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1333/252674/20230119145120402_Gonzalez%20-%20Reddit%20bottomside%20amicus%20brief.pdf) for more details, but below are some excerpts from statements by the moderators:\\n\\n*“To make it possible for platforms such as Reddit to sustain content moderation models where technology serves people, instead of mastering us or replacing us, Section 230 must not be attenuated by the Court in a way that exposes the people in that model to unsustainable personal risk, especially if those people are volunteers seeking to advance the public interest or others with no protection against vexatious but determined litigants.”* \\\\- u/AkaashMaharaj\\n\\n*“Subreddit\\\\[s\\\\]...can have up to tens of millions of active subscribers, as well as anyone on the Internet who creates an account and visits the community without subscribing. Moderation teams simply can't handle tens of millions of independent actions without assistance. Losing \\\\[automated tooling like Automoderator\\\\] would be exactly the same as losing the ability to spamfilter email, leaving users to hunt and peck for actual communications amidst all the falsified posts from malicious actors engaging in hate mail, advertising spam, or phishing attempts to gain financial credentials.” -* u/Halaku\\n\\n*“if Section 230 is weakened because of a failure by Google to address its own weaknesses (something I think we can agree it has the resources and expertise to do) what ultimately happens to the human moderator who is considered responsible for the content that appears on their platform, and is expected to counteract it, and is expected to protect their community from it?” - Anonymous moderator*\\n\\n**What you can do**\\n\\nUltimately, while the decision is up to the Supreme Court (the oral arguments will be heard on February 21 and the Court will likely reach a decision later this year), the possible impact of the decision will be felt by all of the people and communities that make Reddit, Reddit (and more broadly, by the Internet as a whole).\\n\\nWe encourage all Redditors, whether you are a lurker or a regular contributor or a moderator of a subreddit, to make your voices heard. If this is important or relevant to you, share your thoughts or this post with your communities and with us in the comments here. And participate in the public debate regarding Section 230.\\n\\nEdit: fixed italics formatting.\", 'author': 'DefendSection230', 'link_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/10h2fz7/reddits_defense_of_section_230_to_the_supreme/', 'link_permalink': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/10h2fz7/reddits_defense_of_section_230_to_the_supreme/', 'post_date': 1687351691.0, 'ups': 1, 'likes': None}\n",
